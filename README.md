# GoalCue 🎯

A personal goal tracking application designed to help you stay active and achieve your objectives through intelligent cueing and progress monitoring.

## 📋 Overview

GoalCue is a modern web application built to help users track personal goals and receive timely reminders to stay active and focused on their objectives. The app provides an intuitive interface for goal management with smart cueing features.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a **monorepo** structure powered by **Turborepo** to manage multiple interconnected parts of the application:

- **Web App**: Built with TanStack Start (React + TypeScript)
- **Shared Packages**:
  - `react-kit` - Reusable React components and utilities
  - `utils` - Common utility functions and helpers
- **Shared Tooling**:
  - TypeScript configurations and build tools
  - ESLint configurations for code linting
  - Prettier configurations for code formatting
  - Tailwind CSS configurations for styling

All shared packages are compiled in the monorepo but changes are reflected live in apps when modifications occur.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (v10.13.1 or higher)
